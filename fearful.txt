"You never answered my question earlier."

"Do you think we are 'fearful'? Do you think we should be 'scared' of one another?"
"I'll do whatever it takes to win this race, and get the 'corpse parts'."

"To get the 'corpse', Johnny..."
"Would you even risk your life?"

"..."
"Yes."
"Does that make me 'terrifying'?"
"Gyro..."
"I, well-"

"..."

"I don't want to be someone for you to 'fear'!"
"This race, the 'corpse'..."
"If it wasn't for you, it never would have been possible, not in my wildest fantasies."
