...
I shut the book.
I slam it shut, I pick it up, and I throw it on the ground.
The "complete record" book is still open. For a while, I was flipping through it and the "hakurei record" version to compare.
Because I could work harder. I could be a better shrine maiden.
But what the hell is a \"better shrine maiden\"?

Kitou...
Kitou, Kitou, Kitou!
My great-grandmother was killed for this!?

"YUKARI!!"
"I KNOW YOU'RE LISTENING!!"
"I KNOW YOU CAN TELL I READ THIS BOOK!!"

I pick it up and wave it around in the air.

"What is WRONG with you!?"
"You knew one of us would find this! You PRINTED it!!"
"You...!"
"..."

...But nobody came.
...
Compared to Kitou... I think I already am the "better shrine maiden".
Gah, I can tell. I hate that I can tell.
That \"Human Expansion Project\"... would have led to a great disaster.
We have the highest authority, so if a Hakurei wanted something like that to pass, no matter the consequences, it eventually would.
But that doesn't matter...!
Something like this, something about this, it's all wrong!
It-

"Reimu?"
"Reimu, are you okay? Did something happen?"

Aunn steps into the shed.
Ah... I didn't mean to worry her.

"Aunn... I'm fine."
"I just read something awful."

"Oh... do you want something to cheer you up?"
"I just bought us some treats from the village!"

"Maybe later."
"...I know we don't have any of them so far, but is it alright if I establish a rule for the shrine?"

"Um, sure? I'll do my best!"

"\"Don't let the gap youkai do anything weird.\""
"That's it. If Yukari ever tries to talk to you, or you see any evidence of her sneaking around..."
"Tell me immediately."
"If I'm not there, tell Marisa, then... I don't know, everyone you can find."
"And tell them to not go along with her, even if it would be the right thing to do."
"What I just read, Aunn..."
"This book..."
"..."

Geh.

"...What is it? What's that book?"

"Nevermind, whatever."
"That's a real new rule, though."
"Rule two, don't tell Marisa about the things in this shed."
"If she knew such a fancy-looking book was here..."

"Got it!"

"I'll join you for the treats later."
"...Thanks for picking them up."

"Okay!"

She's always so chipper... I'm glad I got to see her just then.
But this all really bugs me.
Should I go to the tengu with this to try and 'expose' Yukari?
No... she wouldn't care. Hell, I bet most of the tengu lived through the idea of the \"Human Expansion Project\". I don't want to bring it back up.
It's all just so frustrating.
Maybe I should leave.
I'll just go outside, and not come back. I don't have any children. What's Yukari going to do about that?
Like a kid running away from home...
Ugh.
Those books... I'll finish them later.
That 'spin' thing seems interesting, and I should probably see what happens to those two men that fought Kitou.
Yukari thought enough of them that she kept writing long after her job there was complete, I guess...
Yukari...
Why did you create this country?
Locking us off in this valley, so youkai can survive...
Do you really care about youkai? Do you care at all about humans?
"Gensokyo, the land of fantasy".
Why...?
