The black hole tears at Kitou Hakurei's back, shredding her clothing and clawing her hair.
She tries to get closer to the ground, but Gyro is in the way. He tries to buck her off, but her enhanced-friction grip isn't letting out.
Instead, he just starts punching her.
She can do nothing but accept it, with her hands taken by the grip desperate to stay even slightly further away from the 'vortex', even as it whips the skin from her back.

"Guh!"
"Agh!"

After a few moments, the 'vortex' dissipates, its 'rotation' naturally fading.
Gyro easily pushes Kitou off him with no resistence.
Kitou is bleeding all over, and will take any excuse to give up the fight.
Gyro's legs have taken some damage from Johnny's 'vortex', but not enough to stop him from standing.

"Ugh..."
"Johnny... great work out there."

"Gyro, are you alright?"
"That 'technique'..."
"I-I'm sorry. I knew it was dangerous."

"..."
"You did perfectly."
"I didn't know what you were going to do, but I knew it would work."
