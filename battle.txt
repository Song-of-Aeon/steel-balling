"Listen... I don't know who you are, but trying to be chivalrous is a waste of time."
"Ultimately, you want us to give up. Even if it makes you feel better about yourself, it doesn't change what you're about to try to do."

"Ha! Not that you can even claim to be 'fair' after those cheap shots."
"...Let's get 'er, Johnny."

"Is that what you think...?"
"I didn't mean to be rude, but you're right. I don't really care."

Staring down the woman, Johnny and Gyro prepare themselves to go on the offensive.
Gyro begins to slide his hand into his holster, grabbing his 'steel balls'.
Johnny surveys the landscape, taking note of anything that could be used during the fight.
Kitou lowers her stance, as if about to sprint.

"Johnny... we have the 'advantage' right now."
"In a few seconds, I'm going to throw this 'steel ball'."
"At the same time, I want you to fire around her."

"Got it... I'll spread the shots around so she can't just dodge."

"..."

A moment passes.
Kitou's stance lowers just slightly more...
And she lunges toward them!
At the same time-
...
Nothing.

"Gyro!?"

Johnny keeps his gaze locked to the quickly advancing woman.
At some point, she started 'sliding' towards them instead of running, just like before.

"Shit!"
"What's happened to me!?"
"Johnny, ignore what I said before! Shoot her now!"

1, 2, 3, 4, 5 shots are fired in rapid succession in Kitou's general direction.
Without even seeming like she noticed them, they all fly past her.
She whips through the men for a third time, deciding to slam Gyro with her staff.
Gyro is thrown across the forest, left with a bleeding gash in his side.

"Gyro!!"

As fast as he can, Johnny makes his way over to Gyro as their attacker once again speeds past them.

"Gyro, what the hell happened?"
"Why didn't you throw the 'steel ball'!?"

"That woman... she did something."
"Whatever her 'stand ability' is, it's not something like "super speed"."
"My 'steel ball'... I couldn't get a grip on it."
"It felt like there was nothing to spin, and was even slippery in my hands..."
"...Like carrying a piece of melted ice."

"Ah...!"

"What is it? Did you think of something!?"

"That 'stone' from earlier, it-"

"Agh!"

Interrupted by Gyro's howl of pain, Johnny stammers as he sees the woman once again rush between them, calm as before.
This time, she had swung at Gyro's left arm.
Blood drips from his forearm... but it's not a serious injury.

"Damn, it's hard to aim that."
"Anyway, are you two willing to 'resign' yet?"

"What do you think...?"
"Would only this much blood scare you, lady?"

"You sure are persistent..."
"Do you want to gamble this much on me missing twice? Three times?"
"As many as it takes?"

While Gyro and Kitou argued and gloated meaninglessly, Johnny was thinking back.
That 'effect' that Gyro had seen... he had noticed it once himself.
"(That smooth stone...!)"
"(Back at the lake, when )"

[STAND CUTIN: PATH OF LIES]

[Stand user: Kitou Hakurei]
[Stand name: 「Path of Lies」]
[Anything touched by 「Path of Lies」 will have how much 'friction' it experiences modified. Typically, Kitou uses this ability on herself and her horse in order to gain speed by allowing them to simply slide along the ground without effort. By increasing the friction of her short staff, Kitou can make it a weapon capable of tearing things, even though it's blunt.]
