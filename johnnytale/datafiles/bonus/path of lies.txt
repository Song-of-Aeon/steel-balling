「Path of Lies」, the stand manifestation of Kitou Hakurei's natural ability, gets its name from the doujin song 嘘の勧め (uso no susume). The translation I decided to use is fairly loose.

Cool ability, right? Too bad it dies with her.
But were all of Kitou's efforts in vain? Ultimately, did she sow a seed of rebellion, a hope that one day may lead to the humans of Gensokyo gaining 'freedom'?
No, probably not.
The more inspiring, less naÏve perspective... must have been that of the men that killed her.
Then, is it possible that they managed to contribute such a hope?
Is it possible that their efforts led to something greater, far down the line?
What did Reimu learn, reading those books...?
This frustrating plateau she finds herself in...
Did she find some way to 'turn' it around?
